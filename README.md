# Hello there! 👋

### ℹ️ About me!

🧑‍🎓  I'm Mateusz Lipowicz, aspiring Front-end developer. Crrently I'm finishing last semester of my master degree on AGH University of Science and Technology in the field of studies related to Production and Quality Engineering. 

💻  I really enjoy learning web development, especially coding in JavaScript. From start day of study this language, after HTML and CSS I want more and more. I'm so excited about my potential future job as a Front-end developer. I cannot see myself in other position, this makes me genuinely happy. I have been developing programming skills for the last six months, accurately in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (SCSS). Any kind of problem which I can undertake makes me more curious and with that more motivated to solve it. I have to make this done by the end of a day, becouse without that I'll not be able to sleep.

🧔  Currently I'm creating my portfolio site to showacase projects in it. From day to day I've become better in understanding and implementing new stuff from JavaScript lessons. My plan for the future is to learn React/Angular, styled-components, TypeScript, Redux and obviously stuff related to, a backend like node.js. 

🏐  Outside of programming, I'm lifting weights and from time to time, I'm playing volleyball which was my passion years ago and I had successes in this field.
